|<rep>: Customer screenshot shows at least 24 drives being monitored. Verified that report does indeed cut off additional drives in test environment. Adjusting screen resolution only allows about one additional line to diplay. Request escalation to Dev.|2015-04-18 13:06:42|1 day, 04:57:21  |1 day, 20:49:43  |

|<rep>: Pulled source code and noted that overview report has a fixed height. Monitoring too many reports causes list to excede this height. Is fixed height needed, or can this be changed?                                                                 |2015-04-18 16:55:09|00:38:47         |2 days, 00:38:10 |
